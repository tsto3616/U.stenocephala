# Naviagting this repository:

Welcome to the repository for the study of *Uncinaria stenocephala* genomics. Within this repository, we focus primarily on *U. stenocephala* and its genomics and or transcriptomics; however, we draw on the genomics of four hookworms (Ancylostomatidae), two members of Strongylidae and one member of Chabertidae. These seven comparative genomes were selected for their varied lifecycles and pathogenesis, as well as their close relationship with *U. stenocephala.* The contents of this repository as split into four sections: (1) sampling and sequencing, (2) data preparation and annotation, (3) genomics and transcriptomics and (4) pipeline development and practicing.\

## Why *Uncinaria stenocephala*?

*U. stenocephala* is the most common hookworm of European dogs [@Mart√≠nez-Moreno2007], despite this, this hookworm remains vastly understudied. Much of this species remains unknown, particularly its pathogenic potential - the focus of this study. Among much of the literature it is considered to be clinically irrelevant. This assumption possibly originated from the unpublished conclusions set out by @Miller1968, in which the authors concluded that the blood loss from infection and haemotophagy of *U. stenocephala*is negligible. However, there is significant evidence to suggest that there is immunopathology associated with infection [@gibbs1958a; @dow1959a;@gorski1999], undermining the claims of clinical irrelevance.
